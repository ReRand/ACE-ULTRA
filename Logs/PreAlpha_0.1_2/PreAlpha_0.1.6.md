Pre-Alpha Version 0.1.6

- added map voting
- you can now see other players' arms moving and their guns in their hand 
- updated slam aftermath gravity from 500 to 500000000 to stop bouncing
- I BELIEVE we finally fixed the unanchoring bug
- hotfix for the bug where you can't spawn has been made while we look into it if you press ` it toggles stats and lets you spawn even if it hasn't loaded completely
- changed time it takes to go into slide from 0.2 to 0.3 (don't ask why)
- added a 0.2 second delay before you first pull out your first weapon upon spawning in to fix some bugs
- slam jump height is somehow higher for some reason (??)
- doing /e dance emotes now puts you in third person
- while in 3rd person you can no long use abillities or weapons
- while in 3rd person the arms become normal
- at the moment weapon models are kinda broken I'm gonna work on it tomorrow
