Pre-Alpha Version 0.1.7

- updated map voting
- added a GameRoundMap module for possible debugging/admin features like selecting maps, gamemodes, or starting and ending rounds
- added gamemode voting which currently does nothing
- added a little botom bar where players will be
- added placeholder stuff for style
- added a timer for voting
- mostly fixed slam jump height
- fixed the bridge stairs on ORANGEPLATE so the last step doesn't go under the bridge
- fixed the bridge stairs (but not the building stairs because I forgot) on ORANGEPLATE so that you can actually walk up them better
- fixed a loading issue with map loading where if you were the first member of a server it would start the map vote early while you were still loading
